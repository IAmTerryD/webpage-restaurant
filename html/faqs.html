        Where is the restaurant located?
      </p>
      <p class="text-body-sm">
        We are located at 11 Madison Avenue, on the corner of East 24th Street and Madison Avenue, directly across the
        street from Madison Square Park.

        What type of menu does the restaurant offer?
      </p>
      <p class="text-body-sm">
        We offer three menus, all of which are 100% plant-based. Our main dining room tasting menu is nine to ten
        courses for $365 per guest, traditionally lasting two and a half to three hours, featuring both plated and
        communal
        dishes. The 6-course menu is $285 per guest. Featuring highlights from the Full Tasting menu along with
        tableside
        preparations, lasting roughly two hours. Served in our lounge, we offer a Bar Tasting menu for $195 per guest
        that
        consists of four to five courses, commonly lasting one and a half to two hours.

        What are your Covid-19 precautions and requirements?
      </p>

      <p class="text-body-sm">
        Our guest and staff safety is our top priority. We are no longer asking guests and staff to wear masks indoors
        and
        are no longer checking vaccination cards at the door. Our dining room does have high ceilings, and we have
        installed a new air filtration system to increase air circulation for our guests. If you have specific concerns
        or
        questions, please contact our Guest Relations team at info@restaurant.com.

        Do you require proof of vaccination?
      </p>

      <p class="text-body-sm">
        Currently, Eleven Madison Park does not require proof of vaccination. Our policy will remain dynamic to keep in
        line with CDC recommendations and NYC mandates.

        How far in advance can I make a reservation?
      </p>

      <p class="text-body-sm">
        We open up reservations on the first of every month for the following month - for example, on October 1st, all
        of
        November will be made available. If you find that the reservation you were hoping for is booked, we do hold a
        waitlist and encourage you to add your name to it, and if something does become available, we will be in touch.
